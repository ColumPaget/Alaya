#Alaya will rotate logs when they hit this size
MaxLogSize=100M

# Max RSS and Stack. These are conservative, if using something monstrous like PHP or JAVA
# (both of which must be used via command-line programs like php-cgi) then these will
# need to be increased. Alaya's default is larger, and seems okay for PHP
MaxMemory=50M

###### Directory Page Settings ######
# These settings relate to the 'directory listing' page. Some of them only
# apply if DirListType is 'Full' or 'Interactive'

DirListType=Full,MimeIcons
DisplayNameLen=30
PackFormats=tar:internal,zip:zip -,tbz:tar -jcO,txz:tar -JcO

####### Authentication Settings ######

#Methods allowed to authenticate user. Default is just 'native'
AuthMethods=pam-account,cookie,accesstoken,certificate,native

#Path to file that contains 'native' authentication details
AuthPath=/etc/FileServices.auth

#Realm used to ask people to log on to (defaults to hostname)
AuthRealm=whatever

#Who can log in, who can't
AllowUsers=Eve,Mallory

########  SSL Settings  #######

#Minimum allowed SSL/TLS version options are ssl, tls, tls1.1, tls.1.2
SSLVersion=tls1.2

#SSL Ciphers to use (this is in openssl format)
SSLCiphers=DH+AESGCM:DH+AES256:DH+CAMELLIA256:ECDH+AESGCM:ECDH+AES256:ECDH+AES128:DH+AES:EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:ECDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA:CAMELLIA256:CAMELLIA128:DES-CBC3-SHA:!ADH:!AECDH:!MD5

#Personally I normally supply these on command line
# SSLKey=/etc/ssl/local.key
# SSLCert=/etc/ssl/local.crt

#How to treat client certificates. 'required' means one is needed to log in, but username/password or access token may also
#be required. 'sufficient' means a valid certificate is enough to log on. 'required+sufficient' means here must be one, and
#it's enough to log in
SSLClientCertificate=sufficient

#Path to file that contains the CA certificate used to validate client certificates
SSLVerifyPath=/etc/ssl/ColumsCerts.crt

#Path to file that contains Diffie-Helman parameters for perfect forward secrecy
SSLDHParams=/etc/ssl/dh/dh_param_1024.pem

# Turn this on to use eliptic curve, or DH with auto-generated params 
#PerfectForwardSecrecy=yes

#######  VPaths and FileType Settings  ######
#### NOTE: Options like cache=3600 or user=nobody are optional, alaya has default values for these

#Settings that apply to file types
FileType=*.jpg,cache=3600,compress=N
FileType=*.mp3,cache=3600,compress=N

#A cgi VPath. If a file is accessed under /cgi-bin/, then look in /usr/share/cgi for it, and treat it as a program to run
Path=cgi,/cgi-bin/,/usr/share/cgi,user=clamav,group=pppd

#A files VPath. Documents under the URL /public/ are in /home/public, and can be accessed even if this directory is outside chroot
Path=files,/public/,/home/public,cache=120,uploads=Y

#Proxy VPath, when someone asks for he directory /google, get it from http://www.google.com/
Path=proxy,/google,http://www.google.com/

#'Logout' VPath, used to re-authenticate and switch user
Path=logout,/Logout

#MimeIcons VPath. This is used on the 'directory listing' page to find icons to display for files
Path=MimeIcons,/mimeicons,/home/app-themes/icons/Free-file-icons-master/32px/$(FileExtn).png,/home/app-themes/icons/mediatype-icons/gnome-mime-$(mimeclass)-$(mimesub).png,/home/app-themes/icons/nuvola/32x32/filesystems/$(type).png,/home/app-themes/icons/FreeUserInterfaceIcons/$(type).png,/home/app-themes/icons/nuvola/32x32/mimetypes/unknown.png,cache=3600


##### Scripts and websockets #####
# Lookup script md5, sha1, sha256 or sha512 hashes in a file. Alaya will check the file before running a 
# cgi script/program and only run it if there's a matching entry in the file. This means that if you specify 
# this option then you must put the correct hashes in the file for cgi scripts to work.
# Hashes can be generated with md5sum, shasum or sha256sum or sha512sum. They should be generated against
# the full path of the script files
ScriptHashFile=/etc/alaya-scripts.hash

###### For files ending in .pl use /usr/bin/perl as their interpreter, even if they lack a #! line
ScriptHandler:pl=/usr/bin/perl

######## Websockets #########
# For any URL (*) and the requested protocol 'test' run /tmp/test.sh
WebsocketHandler:*:test=/tmp/test.sh


######  EVENTS  #######
# When certain things happen, trigger a script etc.
# Event Types: 
# Path (when a Path is requested), 
# Method (when an HTTP Method is requested),
# Header (when a Client Header is sent), 
# User (when a matching User logs in)
# Peer (request from a matching peer)
# ResponseCode (when the server sends a particular response code) 
# BadURL (when the server considers a requested URL to be malformed)
